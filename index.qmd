# World Athletics Database
Some 400k athlete performances for various events scraped from [World Athletics](https://worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/sprints/100-metres/outdoor/women/senior).



## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
make init
```

Next, you can parse and post-process the data:

```python
poetry run python world_athletics_database/parse.py
poetry run python world_athletics_database/postprocess.py
```

**Note:** Parsing the data may take up to 20 minutes.

## Data Dictionary

## Data Sample

Here's all the world record performances that are stored in the data set, sorted by date.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate

df = pd.read_csv("data/data.csv", delimiter=";", parse_dates=True)

Markdown(
    tabulate(
        df.loc[df["Rank"] == 1][
            ["Event", "Competitor", "Mark", "Sex", "Date"]
        ].sort_values("Date")
    )
)

```
